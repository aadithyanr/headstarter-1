    <h3 id="hardware">here lies a collection of products that I thoroughly enjoy using üëáüèæ</h3>

    <p>hopefully I keep this updated</p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <p><b> Sky:</b> Apple bought them, but the app still lives on (on iOS). During my time at Rice, Dark Sky saved
          me from getting soaked more times than I can count. The precipitation predictions were spot on and prompt.
          However, beyond the neat features, the base UI has always been my favorite. When I look at the weather for the
          day, the high and low temperatures are great, but why not just show a distribution of the temperatures
          throughout the day? Dark Sky does exactly this, allowing me to take a quick look at the weather for the day
          and understand what I need to wear depending on what time it is.

        </p>

      </li>
      <li>
        <p><b> Winno:</b> During the 2020 election, I realized how painful it was to stay on top of the news. There were
          too many sources, too much overlap, and a lot of noise to filter through. I was looking at Twitter, Reddit, NY
          Times, WSJ, and cable news, but I still never felt like I had a good grasp of the timeline of events or any
          sense of a single news story. Winno lets me see fact-checked stories in a timeline format so I can see what
          happened earlier for a specific topic, have the full timeline of events easily available for me, and the
          sources for each headline. I stopped checking Reddit, Twitter, and news apps for headlines after downloading
          the app.
